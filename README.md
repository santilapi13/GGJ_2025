## What is Soda Boom?
It's a videogame developed in Godot in 48 hours for the Global Game Jam 2025.

Cocho the Soda Deliveryman receives a huge order that could save his business. He loads his truck to the brim. Instantly, the Joy Train crashes into his vehicle, destroying it and scattering the order all over the city.

Without a vehicle and suffering from a concussion, Cocho‚Äôs top priority is delivering the order on foot. To succeed, he must recover the lost bottles, relying on his effervescent knowledge to get the job done
